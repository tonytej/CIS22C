 
waiting door find you’re up no good  
you don’t have like it  
knocks again, won’t leave though you wish it would  
you don’t have like it  
it’s a reminder, a subliminal thing  
you don’t have like it  
you’ve been acquainted so don’t pretend forget  
this isn’t different  
 
 
how can we forget almighty?  
go  
sh  
 
 
it shows up say i’m right you’re wrong  
you don’t have like it  
knocks again says you’ve known all  
you don’t have like it  
it’s a reminder, a visceral thing  
you don’t have like it  
just when you think you’re alone, there’s no escaping it  
you can never get away with it  
 
 
how can we forget almighty?  
how can we forget almighty?  
go  
sh  
 
 
you don’t have like it  
you don’t have like it  
you don’t have like it  
you don’t have like it  
how can we forget almighty?  
how can we forget almighty?  
go  
sh
