Paper Route
Chariots
Pop


[Verse 1]
Love is never invincible
It’s the mystical, a body into a soul
You, you thought of me differently
Traded everything, a moment in memory


[Pre-Chorus 1]
You promised me that everything is fair
If it’s love and war
But you're giving up the fight
Is it not worth fighting for?
All of this tethered to the heart
Holding what you meant
If it’s really what you want
Then I confidently send
(Chariots)


[Chorus]
I send my love to carry it
Without your guard our chariots fall
(Chariots)
No part of us left innocent
Without your heart our chariots fall
(Chariots)


[Verse 2]
Blind to think you would never thirst
In the burning earth
And trade what our love is worth
I am sewn to your sleeve
Refuse to retreat


[Pre-Chorus 2]
I’m chasing every shadow off the wall
I am caught in time
All these chemicals I take
Can't erase you from my mind
All of this tethered to a thought
I am holding here
If it’s really what you want
Then I’ll patiently prepare
(Chariots)


[Chorus]
I send my love to carry it
Without your guard our chariots fall
(Chariots)
No part of us left innocent
Without your heart our chariots fall
(Chariots)


[Bridge]
I’m losing my faith
I’m losing it all
Just give me a chance before
(Chariots fall)
Where’s the blood?
Where’s the blood?
Where’s the blood?


I’m losing my faith
I’m losing it all
Just give me a chance before
(Chariots fall)
Where’s the blood?
Where’s the blood?
Where’s the blood?


I’m losing my faith
I’m losing it all
Just give me a chance before
Where’s the blood?
Where’s the blood?
Where’s the blood?


(Chariots fall)
