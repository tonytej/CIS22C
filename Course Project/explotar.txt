[Bridge: Rob Birch (Stereo MC's)]
You can walk everyday 'till your fingers are gone
What's the point if you don't feel nothing at all?
We've been used and abused
We can't take anymore
[?]
So wake up, wake up
Tell me what do you feel
It's a new day, a new thought
That's what is real
Wake up, wake up
'Till it's joy that you feel
'Cause life's energy is all that is real


[Chorus: Maluca]
