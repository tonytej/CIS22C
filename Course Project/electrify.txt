[Intro]
Electrify


[Verse 1]
Strangers in the night making shadows on the wall
Creatures in the wild, aren't we all?
So come on, I kinda like the way you roll
Visions in the mind move away and take a hold


So come on, I kinda like the way you roll


[Chorus]
Don't wanna take my time, I wanna chase the lightning
Electrify-fy-fy-fy
Under the midnight sky, girl, you're electrifying
Electrify
Electrify


[Verse 2]
Tangled in your eyes, I can never get enough
Reeling in the line of your drug
So come on, I know you like to take control, babe
Anyway you like, baby, I can turn it up
Lasers in my eyes when we touch
So come on, I kinda like the way you roll


[Chorus]
Don't wanna take my time, I wanna chase the lightning
Electrify-fy-fy-fy
Under the midnight sky, girl, you're electrifying
Electrify
Electrify


[Chorus]
Don't wanna take my time, I wanna chase the lightning
Under the midnight sky, girl, you're electrifying
Electrify
Electrify
