Bye Bye
Pop


[Verse 1]
Sold his soul to [?]
Worthless individual that knows everything
Don't hold back he's not pleasant or sweet
It's ignorance and jealousy that make's his heart beat


You don't know
You can't hurt him back


[Pre-Chorus]
Cause he's a fly on the wall
Yes an insect that crawls
If pesticide won't do it we've got nothing at all


[Chorus]
Bye bye
And I won't hurt like that
Bye bye
And I won't hurt like that (Hurt like that)


[Verse 2]
Sold his soul for a [?]
Hiding insecurity through this masquerade
Fi gets fi now there’s blood on the screen
It trips up on the floorboards but it’s conscious is clean


You don't know
You can't hurt him back


[Pre-Chorus]
Cause he's a fly that won't stall
Yes an insect that crawls
He validates his existence through the posts on your walls


[Chorus]
Bye bye
And I won't hurt like that
Bye bye
And I won't hurt like that (Hurt like that)
Bye bye
And I won't hurt like that
Bye bye
I won't hurt like that (Hurt like that)
Bye bye
Bye bye

Tearing Me Up
Pop


[Verse 1]
Let me tell you about a little situation
It's been testing my patience, man, she was keeping me up all night
Cause you only get so far reading faces
We were off to the races and I thought to myself hold tight
You see there was just this one complication
She was already taken and what was so wrong felt so right
She said no need to be looking over your shoulder
When you could just come over and we can work this out just fine


[Chorus]
I don't know what you want from me
So careless in your company
I will follow what you say is true
There'll be no getting over you
So we're now playing by your rules
If you're a joker then I'm a fool
I guess there's no catching up to you


If you don't want my affection
Don't lie, you're tearing me up
Cause you've got all my attention
I won't lie, you're tearing me up
I'm trying to tell your intention
When you lie, you're tearing me up
If you don't want my affection
You won't mind, you're tearing me up


[Verse 2]
It all started with a simple conversation
It was on the weekend and she was talking me up all night
Kept asking if I was only faking
She was there for the taking
Showing me that she was all mine
She told me she lived just around the corner
I wanted to know her, yeah, she was making me lose my mind
I didn't know quite what I was chasing
She had my heart racing
And all between it was just one night


[Chorus]
I don't know what you want from me
So careless in your company
I will follow what you say is true
There'll be no getting over you
So we're now playing by your rules
If you're a joker then I'm a fool
I guess there's no catching up to you


If you don't want my affection
Don't lie, you're tearing me up
Cause you've got all my attention
I won't lie, you're tearing me up
And I'm trying to tell your intention
When you lie, you're tearing me up
If you don't want my affection
You won't mind, you're tearing me up


I don't know what you want from me
So careless in your company
I will follow what you say is true
There'll be no getting over you
So we're now playing by your rules
If you're a joker then I'm a fool
I guess there's no catching up to you


If you don't want my affection
Don't lie, you're tearing me up
Cause you've got all my attention
I won't lie, you're tearing me up
I'm trying to tell your intention
When you lie, you're tearing me up
If you don't want my affection
You won't mind, you're tearing me up
