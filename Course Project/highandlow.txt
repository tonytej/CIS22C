Empire of the Sun
High and Low
Indie Pop


[Verse 1]
Now we are running in a pack to the place you don't know
And I want you to know that I'll always be around
Down where the summer and the late nights last forever
There's a house on the hill and we can't travel now


[Pre-Chorus]
Alice D you’re on your way up
Way up
Way up


[Chorus]
I feel most times we're high and low (high and low)
If I had my way, never let you go (never let you go)
I feel most times we're high and low (high and low)
If I had my way, never let you go (never let you go)


[Verse 2]
Let's get together and forget all the troubles and just float
I don't want you to go
I need to be closer to now


[Pre-Chorus]
Alice D you’re on your way up
Way up
Way up


[Chorus]
I feel most times we're high and low (high and low)
If I had my way, never let you go (never let you go)
I feel most times we're high and low (high and low)
If I had my way, never let you go (never let you go)


[Bridge]
Alice D is on her way home
She's been out all night again
She don't want nobody's help now
She sees stars and rocket ships


[Chorus - fade out]
I feel most times we're high and low (high and low)
If I had my way, never let you go (never let you go)
I feel most times we're high and low (high and low)
If I had my way, never let you go (never let you go)
I feel most times we're high and low (high and low)
If I had my way, never let you go (never let you go)
I feel most times we're high and low (high and low)
If I had my way, never let you go (never let you go)
