Shelter
Electronic


[Instrumentals]


[Verse 1]
I could never find the right way to tell you
Have you noticed I've been gone?
'cause I left behind the home that you made me
But I will carry it along


[Chorus]
And it's a long way forward, so trust in me
I'll give them shelter, like you've done for me
And I know, I'm not alone, you'll be watching over us
Until you're gone


[Instrumentals]


[Verse 2]
When I'm older, I'll be silent beside you
I know words won't be enough
And they won't need to know our names or our faces
But they will carry on for us


[Chorus]
And it's a long way forward, so trust in me
I'll give them shelter, like you've done for me
And I know, I'm not alone, you'll be watching over us
Until you're gone


[Instrumentals]


[Outro]
Oh it's a long way forward, trust in me
I'll give them shelter, like you've done for me
And I know, I'm not alone, you'll be watching over us
Untilâ€¦
