Lewis Del Mar
Painting
Rock


[Verse 1]
The walls are boring me
Paint it like you always dreamed it'd be
Turquoise, neon green
Paint it like you always dreamed it'd be


[Pre-Hook]
Throw like Pollock
Fuck the apartment
Oh, paint it like you always dreamed it'd be


[Pre-Hook]
(Oh, ooh)
(Oh, ooh ooh)
(Oh, ooh)
(Oh, ooh ooh)


[Hook]
If you want it, you can have it
Every color that you see, see, see
If you want it, want it bad
Build yourself a technicolor masterpiece, oh
Masterpiece, masterpiece
Oh, yeah


[Verse 2]
A rainbow kitchen floor
You're laughin' like you always dreamed you'd be
(Come on, let's paint the door, ooh)
Handprints on the ceiling where our dreams will reach


[Pre-Hook]
So 'John Mchale-esque'
Straight lines don't exist
When you're livin' like you always dreamed it'd be


[Pre-Hook]
(Oh, ooh)
(Oh, ooh ooh)
And I don't know what to [?]
(Oh, ooh)
(Oh, ooh ooh)


[Hook]
If you want it, you can have it
Every color that you see, see, see
If you want it, want it bad
Build yourself a technicolor masterpiece, oh
Masterpiece, masterpiece
Oh, yeah


[Bridge]
And many years from now
The landlord will kick us out
He'll cover all our sins
He'll paint it white again
And many years from now
The landlord will kick us out
He'll cover all our sins
He'll paint it white again
(Oh, ooh)
(Oh, ooh ooh)
White, oh no, yeah, yeah
(Oh, ooh)
(Oh, ooh ooh)
(Oh, ooh)
(Oh, ooh ooh)


[Hook]
If you want it, you can have it
Every color that you see, see, see, yeah
If you want it, want it bad
Build yourself a technicolor masterpiece, nah, nah, oh
Masterpiece, masterpiece
