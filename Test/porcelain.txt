Porcelain
Indie Pop


[Verse 1]
Hold your horses
Hold, hold the border
Don't come closer
Don't, don't let go of me
I'm like porcelain
When you're with me
All, all I know is


[Chorus]
Just about a million ways to harm you
All the things I shouldn't say
Are the things that when I want to make you happy
Only comes out of me


[Verse 2]
What if I dropped, dropped the steering wheel
Closed my eyes
Drove, drove faster
I'm like porcelain
When I love you
I, I know it's


[Chorus]
Just about a million ways to harm you
All the things I shouldn't say
Are the things that when I want to make you happy
Only comes out of me
We have got the power of destruction
You can always let it fall
But when we try to work on something solid
It is too goddamn hard


[Bridge]
Give it a thought, it takes a lot
To trust that someone else will catch my fall
It takes a lifetime, breaking goes fast
When everything that matters made of glass


[Chorus]
Just about a million ways to harm you
All the things I shouldn't say
Are the things that when I want to make you happy
Only comes out of me


Just about a million ways to harm you
All the things I shouldn't say
Are the things that when I want to make you happy
Only comes out of me


We have got the power of destruction
You can always let it fall
But when we try to work on something solid
It is too goddamn hard


[Outro]
I'm like porcelain
I'm like porcelain
I'm like porcelain
I'm like porcelain
I'm like porcelain
