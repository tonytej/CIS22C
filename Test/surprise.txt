Surprise
Electronic


[Verse 1]
Speak and open up your mind
It's something you should do all the time
Keep exploring, seek and find
You know you might surprise yourself
Talk without a taint to hold
The doubts that should embrace your heart
The calm and chaos of your soul
You know you might surprise yourself


[Verse 2]
Take a pen and write this down
Draw something that can't be found
And learn to walk again somehow
You know you might surprise yourself


[Verse 3]
Lover, if you only knew
The times that train has fooled me too
And tears me from a place I know
It helps me to surprise myself
You know you can surprise yourself
So let go and surprise yourself
